**Ticket 2: Jorge’s Backup Drive**

Jorge Thompson writes: “Hello IT team, I’ve been running out of hard drive space so I had your weekend technician add a new internal hard drive. We were working on this pretty late so we didn’t finish the process. I know it’s all plugged in physically, but Windows doesn’t show the new hard drive. Can you help?”
