REM Optimal destination for storing backup files:
REM In a real-world scenario, the optimal destination for storing backup files depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, redundancy, and accessibility requirements.
REM - Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices are a good choice for centralized backups accessible over the network.
REM - External hard drives or removable media are suitable for offline backups and portability.
REM - Cloud storage services offer remote backups with redundancy and accessibility from anywhere.
REM The choice should align with data retention policies, disaster recovery plans, and security considerations.

REM Explanation of the script:

REM @echo off: Disables echoing of commands to the console.

REM The script prompts the user to input the source and destination folder paths using set /p.

REM It checks if the source folder exists. If not, it displays an error message and exits.

REM It checks if the destination folder exists. If not, it creates the destination folder.

REM It uses ROBOCOPY to recursively copy files and subdirectories from the source to the destination.

REM After the copy operation, it checks the errorlevel to determine if ROBOCOPY was successful. Errorlevel 16 indicates a failure.

REM The script provides appropriate messages to the user and pauses for user interaction.
