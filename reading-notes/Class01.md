## Windows System Restore Q&A

### 1. What is the purpose of the Windows System Restore tool?

The purpose of the Windows System Restore tool is to revert the operating system to a previous software, registry, and driver configuration known as a restore point. This can be extremely useful for resolving major issues that may arise.

### 2. How long does it usually take to use the System Restore tool in Windows?

It usually takes between **10 to 30 minutes** to complete the System Restore process in Windows.

### 3. How do you start a System Restore from the command prompt?

To start a System Restore from the command prompt, you would:
1. Open the `Command Prompt`.
2. Type `rstrui.exe` and press `Enter`.
This will open the System Restore wizard, where you can then follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.

### 4. What options are available if System Restore did not fix the problem?

If System Restore did not resolve the issue, you have a couple of options:
1. **Repeat the System Restore**: You can go through the System Restore process again and choose an even older restore point, assuming one is available.
2. **Continue Troubleshooting**: Keep diagnosing the issue without relying on System Restore.
   - Additionally, if the System Restore ended up causing another issue, you have the option to undo it.
