# Psychological Safety

## Discussion

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?
   * communication, freedom, collaboration

2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.
   * During my time as Director of Postal Operations at Ramstein Air Base I was one of 2 civilians in high level squadron leadership positions.  I refuse to say yes to economically inefficient ideas and strategies especially when they negatively impact the people I am responsible for.  My resolute position on operation efficiency and caring for my team while holding members responsible for poor decision making was got me in trouble (unpaid suspensions, write-ups, illnesses, crying every day before work) countless times.  However, I look back on the experience now and I know that I didn't once sacrifice my core values for an organization that doesn't actually care about the people who create it.  I did my best to bring love into a soulless machine.  I succeeded.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?
   * overall well-being and balance.  Fulfillment.
   * happy employees are profitable and productive
   * safe and happy is the game changing formula that seems to get overlooked by most large organizations in pursuit of profit
