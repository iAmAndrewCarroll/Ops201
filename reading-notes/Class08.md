**1. What is the Windows Registry, and what does it store?**

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database where Windows and various programs store their configuration settings. It contains folder-like structures called "keys" and "values" inside those keys that can contain numbers, text, or other data.

**2. What are the two types of registry settings stored for each Windows user account?**

There are system-wide registry settings that apply to all users, and each Windows user account also has its own user-specific settings. The system-wide settings are stored in files under `C:\Windows\System32\Config\`, while each Windows user account has its own `NTUSER.dat` file containing its user-specific keys in its `C:\Windows\Users\Name` directory.

**3. What are “registry hacks” and why might someone want to use them?**

"Registry hacks" are modifications made to the Windows Registry to enable hidden features, customize system behavior, or tweak specific options. People might want to use them to gain more control over their system, unlock features not exposed by default, or to optimize performance.

**4. What are some common tasks you can perform by editing the Windows Registry?**

Some common tasks that can be performed by editing the Windows Registry include:

- Displaying a message at sign-in
- Enabling hidden features in Windows Defender
- Cleaning up the context menu
- Adding custom options to the context menu
- Disabling the lock screen on Windows 10

**5. Imagine you’re explaining the concept of the Windows Registry to someone who has never used a computer before. How would you make this explanation culturally relevant and relatable to their life experiences or background?**

Think of the Windows Registry like the "rulebook" for a traditional board game in your culture. Just like how the rulebook guides the way the game is played, the Windows Registry guides how Windows and its programs behave. You can even change some of these "rules" (akin to house rules in a board game) to suit your preferences, but be cautious as changing them incorrectly could "spoil the game" (render the system unworkable).
