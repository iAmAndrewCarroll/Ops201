**Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles**

**1. What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?**
- The help desk professional is the first line of defense for customers.  They are the first person a customer will talk to when they have a problem.  They are the face of the company and the first impression a customer will have of the company.

**2. The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?**
- Hard skills are specific, measurable skills such as configuring and troubleshooting systems.
- Soft skills are interpersonal skills such as communication and empathy.
- In American culture the kind of skills that are valued really depend on industry and region in a lot of ways.  The community that I keep close really values high level communication and relationships based on interpersonal value and acceptance over hard skills.  I think that the article is pretty spot on with the skills that are valued in the IT industry.

**3. Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?**
- Security skills have become more important in recent years because of the increase in cyber attacks.  Help desk technicians are the first line of defense against these attacks.  They are the ones who are going to be able to identify and stop these attacks before they become a problem.

**4. How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?**
- Writing skills are important because they are the primary form of communication between the help desk technician and the customer.  Critical thinking skills are important because they allow the help desk technician to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions to problems.
